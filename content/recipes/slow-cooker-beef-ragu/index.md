ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 1kg beef chuck steak, cut into 4cm pieces (see note)
  - 1 brown onion, finely chopped
  - 1 celery stalk, finely chopped
  - 1 carrot, finely chopped
  - 1 cup dry red wine
  - 2 x 400g cans cherry tomatoes in juice
  - 1 cup Massel beef stock
  - 2 tablespoons tomato paste
  - 3 sprigs fresh thyme
  - Cooked curly fettuccine, to serve
  - Grated parmesan, to serve
  - Fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped, to serve
  - Salt, to season
method:
  - Heat half the oil in a large frying pan over high heat. Cook beef, in two batches, for 5 minutes or until browned. Transfer to the bowl of a 5.5-litre slow cooker.
  - Add remaining oil to pan. Add onion, celery and carrot. Cook for 3 minutes or until just tender.
  - Add wine, tomatoes with liquid from cans, stock, paste and thyme to pan. Bring to the boil. Carefully pour over beef. Stir to combine. Cover with lid.
  - Cook on low for 6 hours (or on high for 4 hours) or until beef is very tender. Stir with a wooden spoon to roughly shred beef. Toss ragu through fettuccine. Season with salt and pepper. Serve topped with parmesan and parsley.

The beauty of slow cooked meals means that after a little prep, the ragu can be left to bubble away until dinner time.
